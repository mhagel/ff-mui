I used create-react-app to get something bootstrapped quickly. To speed up development, I use Github Copilot. It helped me do some boilerplate React component code, and I asked it to give me some a11y tips to make sure I didn't forget anything. I did not spend too much time playing with colors and fonts, but did update them to demonstrate the theme feature of MUI. I rounded the corners a bit and make style tweaks until I felt happy with the look. Nothing too fancy at this point.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
